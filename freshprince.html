		<h1> The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air </h1>
		<h2> From western Philadelphia I hail</h2>
		<h3> where in my youth I'd play upon the green</h3>
		<h4> 'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd</h4>
		<p>	by ruffians contemptible and mean.</p>
		<p>	Although the spat was trivial and brief,</p>
		<p>	it wounded my dear mother deep within;</p>
		<p>	and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,</p>
		<p>	she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.</p>
		<p>	When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,</p>
		<p>	I came upon a coachman most unique;</p>
		<p>	and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,</p>
		<p>	despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.</p>
		<p>	I survey all the land with princely mien</p>
		<p>	in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. </p>
